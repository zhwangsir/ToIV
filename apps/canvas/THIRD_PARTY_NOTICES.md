Development-only packages are not shipped in the application. Their declared
licenses are MIT or Apache-2.0 and can be inspected after `bun install`.

### FFmpeg.wasm

`@ffmpeg/core` 0.12.10 declares `GPL-2.0-or-later`. Its corresponding source is
available from <https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm> and its package
metadata identifies the exact version. Builds that bundle this core must
preserve the GPL notice and satisfy the GPL source-distribution requirements.
The MIT license at the repository root does not override this component's GPL
terms.
